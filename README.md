# Optical_System_Design_of_Avionics_See_through_Displays
This project explores the design of a traditional head-up display (HUD) 
optical system, utilizing a cathode ray tube (CRT) as the image source 
positioned near the entry lens. The system comprises two multi- element 
lens assemblies: an input lens with a focal length of 226.607 mm and an 
exit lens with a focal length of 234.704 mm, achieving a 20-degree field 
of view.
The HUD optical system is divided into two primary 
components: the entry lens system and the exit lens system. The 
entry lens or rear lens system, positioned near the CRT, is tasked 
with collecting and focusing light. It comprises multiple lenses with 
specific effective focal lengths, radii of curvature, and center 
thicknesses. These lenses are designed to work together to minimize 
initial optical aberrations and ensure sharp image projection. 
The exit lens or front lens group is responsible for refining the 
focused light and enhancing overall image clarity. It includes a Plano 
convex lens and an achromatic doublet, which are optimized to reduce 
chromatic and spherical aberrations. The integration of these 
components is essential for achieving the desired image quality and 
performance metrics. 
We used precise tools to measure the curvature of each lens, which 
helped us calculate how light bends through them. Our goal was to 
arrange the lenses in a way that minimizes distortion and delivers sharp 
images. Advanced optical software was used to simulate and refine the 
design, ensuring it meets the high standards required for aviation use. 
This system aims to improve pilot awareness by displaying essential 
information directly on the cockpit window.
