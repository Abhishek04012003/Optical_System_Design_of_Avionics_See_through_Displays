# Optical_System_Design_of_Avionics_See_through_Displays
This project explores the design of a traditional head-up display (HUD) 
optical system, utilizing a cathode ray tube (CRT) as the image source 
positioned near the entry lens. The system comprises two multi- element 
lens assemblies: an input lens with a focal length of 226.607 mm and an 
exit lens with a focal length of 234.704 mm, achieving a 20-degree field 
of view.
